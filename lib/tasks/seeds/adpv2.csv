1,Christian McCaffrey CAR ,RB1,1.2,13,"You can try to make the argument that McCaffrey shouldn‘t go No. 1 overall this year, but you‘d lose the argument. Outside of saying, “running backs don‘t repeat as the top option,"" there‘s nothing that should suggest McCaffrey won‘t. He‘s not just a running back. He‘s a wide receiver. He scored 182.5 half-PPR points through the air alone, which would‘ve been the No. 20 wide receiver in fantasy last year, ahead of Stefon Diggs.

Playing through injury was a clear net-negative to his overall numbers, and something he hopefully learned from. The biggest difference was breakaway runs of 15-plus yards, as Barkley rattled off 20 of them in his rookie season, but just nine of them in his sophomore season. With all the weapons in this offense, you have to wonder just how many targets Barkley will get, but trust me, the Giants are building their offense around him and not anyone else.

Stop trying to find “the next big thing,"" because Elliott has proven time and time again that he‘s among the safest picks at the top of the draft. He‘s posted RB2 or better numbers in 92.9 percent of his career games, which is better than any running back I‘ve ever charted.

I‘ve already stated in the Drew Brees paragraph that I expect this offense to throw just a bit less in 2020. Initial projections have them around 560 pass attempts, so bringing that down to even a 28 percent target share would force Thomas to lose about 28 targets. You can see why a repeat of last year‘s numbers are unlikely, especially when you factor in the arrival of Emmanuel Sanders as a rock-solid No. 2 receiver who‘ll garner more targets than Ted Ginn and/or Tre‘Quan Smith would‘ve.

The addition of Clyde Edwards-Helaire will not help that, nor will the supposed increase in Mecole Hardman offensive snaps. There were just two games in 2019 where Hill saw double-digit targets, which again, limits his consistency. By comparison, Davante Adams has averaged 11.0 targets per game over the last two years while Julio Jones saw 10-plus targets in 7-of-15 games in 2019. If you want to draft Hill as your WR1, I have no issue with it, but understand that you‘ll need to balance your roster throughout the remainder of the draft.

Meanwhile, Jones has hit that mark in 64.8 percent of his career games and has posted WR1-type numbers in 42.4 percent of them.

In games he started, he posted QB1-type numbers in just 57.1 percent of them. However, there were some factors to take into consideration. One, he was going to regress. Two, he suffered an injury during the Week 7 game against the Broncos that seemed to affect him throughout the remainder of the regular season. In the seven games following that injury, he threw for three touchdowns just once, while throwing for more than 283 yards just twice. Was that a sign of things to come? Probably not considering he threw for 901 yards and 10 touchdowns in three playoff games. You must ask yourself, “What‘s the worst/best-case scenario with Mahomes?"" prior to drafting him. Worst case was probably last year, where he was the No. 52 value-based player. That means if we‘d drafted 2019 all over again, his value would‘ve been correct as the 52nd player selected, so a fifth-round pick. Best case scenario is that he finishes as the No. 5 value-based player like he did in 2018. If you‘re somewhere in the middle, he‘s still worth a third-round pick with upside for more. Most of the time with Mahomes, it all just depends on your particular draft, as there are some who‘ll see him go in the first round of their 1QB league. You‘re baking in too much risk there. As a late-second, early-third round pick, you have some room for growth. Anything beyond that is just a steal.

Despite averaging an elite 9.1 targets per game, Evans posted WR2 or better-type numbers in just 38.5 percent of his games. That ranked 28th among wide receivers. Seriously, guys like Sterling Shepard, Cole Beasley, and Jamison Crowder had higher percentages. Now you take away Jameis Winston, someone who was more than willing to throw the ball into tight coverage all the time, and swap him with one of the most risk averse quarterbacks in football? Evans’ 2.4 yards of separation at target was one of the worst marks among wide receivers, and while it doesn‘t tell the full story, those who watch Evans knows he uses his body extremely well to box out defenders rather than gain multiple yards of separation with precision route running. Look, he‘s still a good player who‘s totaled at least 1,000 yards in each of his first six NFL seasons, so I‘m not completely writing him off, though it does help that he‘s seen at least 8.7 targets per game over the last five years. I don‘t think Brady is as bad as some think at throwing the deep ball anymore, I just don‘t think he does it nearly as often as Winston did/was willing to. I‘m expecting a slight dip in targets and less air yards, which in turn, equals less production for a player like Evans.

We talk all the time about regression when it comes to quarterbacks with a high touchdown rate, and Jackson is no different after posting a ridiculous 9.0 percent touchdown rate in 2019. That‘s going to come down. Lowering that mark to 5.0 percent (which is still above average), he would‘ve thrown 20 touchdowns instead of the 36 that he did. However, something to help offset that is his rushing touchdown output. Based on where his carries took place last year, Jackson should‘ve scored closer to 12 rushing touchdowns rather than the seven that he did. The downside to Jackson is that he‘s a bit thinner than you‘d like as a mobile quarterback. While it‘s tough to get a clean hit on him, we have a history of mobile quarterbacks not withstanding a lot of hits. When you invest a second- or third-round pick on a quarterback, you need him on the field. If Jackson were a lock to play all 16 games, he‘d be my QB1 and well worth a second-round pick.

Despite not being a full-time player until Week 9 and seeing just 84 targets, Brown finished as the No. 21 wide receiver in his rookie season. There have been just 10 wide receivers over the last 10 years who‘ve finished as a top-24 fantasy receiver while seeing fewer than 87 targets. Going back to when Ryan Tannehill started playing, Brown received a very stable 21 percent target share. That‘s not elite. Not bad, but not elite.

If we project Tannehill for 480-500 pass attempts, that‘d amount to 115-120 targets. It is possible Brown‘s target share goes up but staying at 24 percent feels like it‘s repeatable. It‘s important to note that Brown averaged a ridiculous 8.9 yards after the catch last year, a number that isn‘t repeatable. You typically won‘t see even the best of the best receivers average more than 6.0 yards after the catch. If you move Brown down to the 5.5 range, he would‘ve recorded 187 fewer yards and finished as the WR28. Then you must factor in Tannehill‘s ridiculous 7.7 percent touchdown rate regressing, so don‘t automatically assume that Brown‘s efficiency remains the same. He‘s still a phenomenal talent, but he needs to get the bump in pass attempts to take the next step. If I were guaranteed 500 pass attempts out of Tannehill, I‘d draft him as a low-end WR1. It‘s best to be a bit cautious though and have some equity built in, making him a WR2 with serious upside.",10.3,0,0,3.3,65.7,0.5,0.2,3.8,0.1,165.1,0,0,52,1051,8,3,60,1

Just one other team (Eagles) had their tight ends see over a 30.0 percent target share. Hayden Hurst is gone, which shifts those targets to the duo of Andrews and Boyle. While I anticipate some of them moving to the wide receivers, it‘s not a bad thing for Andrews supporters. I think many have forgotten just how hard it is for young tight ends to produce elite numbers, yet Andrews posted 852 yards and 10 touchdowns in his sophomore season on a team that threw the ball just 440 times. He‘s very good. With a slight bump in pass attempts for the team overall combined with the exit of Hurst, and we could see Andrews reach 120 targets this season. My issue with Andrews is that he‘s been a bit more inconsistent than the likes of Travis Kelce and George Kittle, so it takes a bit of projecting to see him reach that tier. Andrews played just 46 snaps per game in 2019, while those two averaged 60 snaps. For me, Andrews is in the tier directly behind them alongside Zach Ertz. If you can get him in the late-fourth or early-fifth round, I‘m good with that. If you take him earlier, you‘re have to project 120 targets.",9.5,0,0,4.3,56.8,0.7,0,0,0,143.2,0,0,64,852,10,0,0,0

There‘s little reason to expect that to change, as the Bears lost Taylor Gabriel and replaced him with an older, slower version in Ted Ginn. There were just two games last season where Robinson finished with fewer than seven targets, making him an easy every-week start. In fact, he posted WR2 or better numbers in 62.5 percent of his games, which ranked fifth behind only Michael Thomas, DeAndre Hopkins, Julio Jones, and Davante Adams. The fact that the Bears snagged Nick Foles only helps the Bears receivers, as they have twice the chance at competent quarterback play.

That‘s not a recipe for success for a wide receiver, though it helps that he‘s the only steady presence at wide receiver. Most will look at the target totals from last year and wonder where his targets come from, but don‘t forget that Thielen saw 298 targets over the previous two seasons. Last year was an incredibly efficient year for the Vikings on the ground, and when you combine the fact that Thielen missed half the season, you can understand why their pass attempts came crashing down to earth. With the defense likely taking a step back after losing many starters, we should expect to see their run-to-pass ratio come back towards the league average, which would help Thielen‘s target potential. Knowing that he‘s the only receiver in the starting lineup who has any chemistry with Cousins, we should expect at least eight targets per game. That calls for him being a high-end WR2 at the very least when he‘s in the lineup, though his injury concerns have to be built into his cost.

Now going to the Falcons, who have one of the better offensive lines in football, with little competition, Gurley could return to RB1 status. It‘s a high-scoring offense where the running backs have averaged 1,383 yards and 9.7 touchdowns on the ground, while averaging another 572 yards and 4.7 touchdowns through the air over the last three years.

But that‘s where fantasy players go wrong. That‘s a one-year sample size. We had 59 career games prior to that we can look at where he was the best game-by-game fantasy wide receiver of all-time. Which do you trust? Everyone on the Browns struggled last year and knowing that Beckham was playing through a hernia only added to the disappointment. 2019 was the first year he‘d posted WR2 or better numbers in less than 66.7 percent of his games (which is ridiculous). We know the offense is changing, but that also comes with some concerns. While in Minnesota last year, Kevin Stefanski‘s wide receivers combined for just 201 targets and a 43.1 percent target share, which ranked as the fourth-lowest mark in football. Stefon Diggs, who is also very talented, saw just 94 targets in 15 games last year. While I don‘t expect the Browns to be as run-heavy as the Vikings were, it‘s an added level of concern. But here‘s the thing - it‘s not like a lot of the wide receivers in the 10-15 range don‘t come with similar issues or question marks. Beckham has done it before and has true No. 1 overall wide receiver upside. He‘s in the prime of his career at 27 years old and his only competition for targets (Jarvis Landry) is coming off hip surgery.

Did you know Michael Gallup averaged more targets per game than Cooper last year? Cooper‘s injury may have played into that but it didn‘t stop him from being one of the best in the league. Based on the number of his targets and where they took place on the field, Cooper should‘ve finished as the No. 23 wide receiver, and not the No. 9 receiver he did. In fact, he was the only receiver in the league who scored 20-plus more fantasy points than he was expected to in both the red zone and outside the red zone. The addition of CeeDee Lamb isn‘t going to make getting targets any easier for Cooper, who‘s now seen 195 targets in 25 games with the Cowboys. Because he‘s not getting the gaudy numbers that some are, Cooper should be considered a semi-volatile WR2 in fantasy who has more WR1 upside than most on a weekly basis.

Now another obstacle to cross. He‘ll have a new quarterback and a new head coach in 2020. The coach (Matt Rhule) also decided they needed to bring in Robby Anderson, a receiver who previously played under him, which could mean the targets get spread out a bit. The good news is that Bridgewater attempted a deep ball on just 7.1 percent of his pass attempts, which was the second-lowest rate in the NFL, and not an area where Moore operates.

In Week 1 and Week 2, when Ben Roethlisberger was on the field, Smith-Schuster saw 16 targets, catching 11 of them for 162 yards. Not too shabby. Insert bad quarterbacks, paired with Smith-Schuster trying to run routes from the perimeter, and it was a recipe for disaster. The Steelers have vowed to put him back in the slot where he belongs, and he‘s getting back Roethlisberger, who‘s continually supported fantasy receivers throughout his long career. Going all the way back to 2008, Ben Roethlisberger‘s No. 1 and No. 2 wide receivers combined for at least 225 targets on eight different occasions, including 334 times when he had Antonio Brown and Smith-Schuster in 2018. With Roethlisberger on the field, the Steelers haven‘t thrown the ball less than 584 times since way back in 2012. It‘s hard to see a scenario where Smith-Schuster doesn‘t see at least 130 targets if he‘s healthy (that would be just a 22.2 percent target share), which is elite volume, so even if he‘s average, he‘d be a high-end WR2. I‘ll leave you with this... Smith-Schuster posted 1,426 yards in his second NFL season at the age of 22. There are just six players who posted more yardage in one of their first two seasons.

The Rams started moving towards more 12 personnel, which includes two tight ends, which in turn leaves just two wide receivers on the field. Knowing Kupp is a slot receiver by nature, it affects him greatly. He actually played just 61 percent of the team‘s snaps in Weeks 16 and 17. But I‘d argue that Jared Goff needs him on the field. While targeting Kupp, Goff posted a 117.0 QB Rating. While targeting everyone else, that number is just 78.6. Sean McVay is consistently evolving as a play caller, which bodes well for Kupp, as he‘ll likely be expanded to different roles moving forward. There are question marks, that much we know. However, we have still yet to see a “bad” season from Kupp in the NFL. I don‘t consider him as safe as his teammate Robert Woods, but Kupp should still be considered a low-end WR2 who has more touchdown upside.

Knowing it‘s unlikely we see a big increase in pass attempts, it‘s hard for him to see an air yards number that is much higher. The reason we can be semi-optimistic with his targets is due to the lack of options around him. Kelvin Harmon and Paul Richardson are gone, along with the 86 targets they saw last year. In comes rookie Antonio Gandy-Golden, and veteran Dontrelle Inman, who was recently signed off the street. If we look at offensive coordinator Scott Turner‘s offense last year, you‘ll see it was very top-heavy when it came to the wide receivers, as D.J. Moore and Curtis Samuel both hit 106-plus targets.

Seriously, stop talking about regression when it comes to Wilson‘s receivers. First it was Doug Baldwin. Regression never really happened. Then there was Lockett. Next, it‘ll be Metcalf.

Prescott‘s numbers have been just as good, if not better. He‘s never finished outside the top-12 quarterbacks and is about to play in the same system that just netted him the QB2 finish.

Despite being on the roster the past two years under Shanahan, Mostert has received 171 carries in 25 games. It‘s tough to see that changing drastically.

I remember last year on the podcast talking about Parker, saying there‘s a clear avenue for him to see 100-plus targets and that if Fitzpatrick was starting, I wanted him on my roster. Here we are 128 targets and a No. 7 wide receiver finish later. Fun fact: Parker and Michael Thomas were the only two receivers who posted at least 55 yards in 13 games last year. You were able to get Parker outside the top 60 wide receivers last year, something that isn‘t happening this time around. His current draft position is right around WR20-22, so you‘re receiving a discount from last year‘s production, and rightfully so. Preston Williams is back from his ACL injury, which isn‘t great news for Parker, who was the No. 34 wide receiver through nine weeks with Williams in the lineup. That was really solid for him considering where he was drafted, but once Williams left, Parker exploded and finished as the No. 2 wide receiver the remainder of the season. Part of the reason that happened was due to Ryan Fitzpatrick‘s willingness to target him relentlessly, as he averaged 9.5 targets per game over that span. To be fair, Williams is coming back, but both Allen Hurns and Albert Wilson have opted out of the season, clearing up 110 targets from last year. Knowing Fitzpatrick is starting the season under center helps me feel more confident in Parker, but there‘s certainly hesitation in drafting him this year as the Dolphins defense is going to be much better, which will result in fewer pass attempts, and that they‘ll be moving to a rookie quarterback at some point. I think he‘s best viewed as a stable WR3 who comes with top-12 upside. If I knew Fitzpatrick would start all year, he‘d be a WR2.",10.9,0,0,4.5,75.1,0.6,0,0,0,174.2,0,0,72,1202,9,0,0,0

The move to Tyrod Taylor is likely going to be a tough one for Allen, as Taylor will lack pass attempts in comparison to Rivers. Even if we were to say the Chargers threw the ball 500 times (Taylor‘s career-high is 437 attempts), that‘s still a massive decrease from the 597 times they threw the ball in 2019. Taking away 97-plus targets will be felt throughout the depth chart, especially when you don‘t score a lot of touchdowns. It does help that the Chargers receiving corps is very top heavy with Allen and Mike Williams, though. Still, it‘s likely there‘ll be less than 250 targets between the Chargers receivers, so Allen isn‘t getting close to the 149 targets he got in 2019. Realistically, he‘s likely to be in the 110-120 target range.

That argument only holds so much water, as Wilson has now finished as a top-three fantasy quarterback in four of the last six seasons. Let me tell you... if Wilson attempted 600 pass attempts, he‘d under consideration as the first quarterback off the board. Despite topping out at 553 attempts, Wilson has thrown at least 31 touchdowns in four of the last five seasons. There‘s been just one season he‘s averaged less than 7.7 yards per attempt. He‘s hit a 6.0 percent touchdown percentage in 6-of-8 career seasons. He‘s the good stuff. Can we anticipate more pass attempts? Sure we can. The first year under Brian Schottenheimer they threw the ball just 427 times. The second year (2019), that number went up to 516 attempts. Why did that happen? Not because the run game wasn‘t effective. It certainly was. It‘s because the Seahawks defense has trended in the wrong direction, which bodes well for Wilson‘s pass attempts. They did just trade for Jamal Adams, which will certainly help matters, but their front seven doesn‘t generate a whole lot of pressure. If they lose Jadeveon Clowney, it only gets worse, but I‘d consider 516 attempts the floor for Wilson in 2020. When you add in the growth/chemistry between Wilson and D.K. Metcalf, the ceiling continues to grow. Don‘t forget that Metcalf was a rookie last year, while Tyler Lockett dealt with injuries over the second half of the season. I can‘t say Wilson gets to 600 pass attempts, but we don‘t need him to in order to produce elite numbers, as we‘ve seen.

As much as we don‘t want to consider Jason Witten a threat, he‘s going to steal some targets.

While it was his rookie season, the Cardinals also had the element of surprise, in that no one had existing tape on the offense. Adding DeAndre Hopkins surely helps his chances, though. Did you know there were six games that Murray didn‘t throw a touchdown last year? Based on where his pass attempts and rushing attempts took place, Murray should‘ve scored the third-most fantasy points among quarterbacks last year. Natural progression to his career should improve efficiency. If you‘re looking for upside, he‘s got it. He belongs in the same tier as guys like Dak Prescott, Russell Wilson, and Deshaun Watson.

Diggs actually led the league in yardage on passes that traveled over 20 yards in the air last year. The Bills are still a run-first team that has a top-tier defense, so it‘s hard to expect a big jump in pass attempts. They targeted their wide receivers 310 times last year, which was a lot for a team that threw the ball just 513 times. The 60.4 percent target share was the fourth-highest mark in the league. So, again, it‘s tough to say there will be more to go around. Knowing that John Brown was fantastic last year (115 targets), as was Cole Beasley (104 targets), it‘s tough to take targets away from them, but we have to start taking them from someone because you don‘t trade for someone like Diggs and not target him. Still, giving him even 115 targets might be too generous, as it‘d completely crush the value of Brown, who already has experience with the quarterback/offense. Realistically, I have Diggs down for 111 targets in my projections. When tied to Allen‘s inconsistencies, that is a WR3 in fantasy who can get into WR2 territory at year‘s end, similarly to the way Brown did last year. Diggs is probably a top-eight wide receiver in the league, but you need to targets to move up the boards in fantasy football.

Hilton has never been a touchdown guy, as his career high is capped out at seven touchdowns. So, he‘s reliant upon targets more than someone like D.K. Metcalf, who can score 10 touchdowns. Not only do we have to worry about Hilton‘s health and age, but we also have to worry about his quarterback‘s. Philip Rivers was not good last year and hasn‘t traditionally thrown to guys like Hilton who are undersized and play on the perimeter.

Did you know he rushed for at least 32 yards in 9-of-15 games last year but never topped 47 rushing yards? That‘s odd, to say the least. The Texans defense will be as bad as it‘s ever been with Watson under center, which should mean even more dropbacks. The reason I‘m still okay drafting Watson as a top-six quarterback: He‘s only thrown 26 touchdown passes in each of the last two years and has still been a top-12 type quarterback in 63.2 percent of his career games, which is the second-highest rate since 2000, behind only Patrick Mahomes.

Now, the question becomes: How much does CeeDee Lamb affect Gallup‘s target share? When Lamb was first drafted, I was concerned, but after sitting down and going through projections, I was still able to find 100-105 targets for him in the offense, which should net him a WR3 finish in fantasy. There are some risks taking him inside the top-30 because you‘re taking on some of the risk that Lamb doesn‘t eat into his target share a bit more, though it‘s a smaller risk knowing we‘ve had a shortened offseason with no preseason action.

It was also the first time since 2004 where he completed less than 61 percent of his passes. Will the upgrade in receivers help him get back on track, or are we at the end for the greatest of all-time? The Patriots offensive line was not particularly good last year, so when you combined that with Brady‘s inability to move at all, you get bad numbers. The Bucs offensive line hasn‘t been good over the last few years, though they were slightly better in 2019, and they did draft tackle Tristan Wirfs in the first round, highlighting the fact that they know Brady needs protection. They don‘t have a James White/Julian Edelman on the roster to be his safety valve, though I suspect Godwin will become that player to him. Will the pass attempts drop off from Jameis Winston? Probably, but know that Bruce Arians has not fallen out of the top 20 in pass attempts since back in 2010. His teams have now been top-five in each of his last three years as a coach. Knowing they don‘t have a running back like Saquon Barkley on the roster, we should expect 580-plus pass attempts, and if you look at the receivers on the roster, and what their career averages are when it comes to yards per target, yards per reception, touchdowns, etc., it‘s hard to say Brady won‘t finish as a top-12 quarterback in 2020. There‘s risk that he‘s just flat-out done, as well as risk of chemistry with no offseason, but Brady did workout with a lot of the skill-position players even when the NFL advised against it.

Outside of those four explosion games, Jones was a train wreck, finishing with 14.7 or fewer fantasy points in the eight other games he started. His matchups where he exploded were against the Washington Football team, Bucs, Jets, and Lions. That‘s a far cry from his start to the season in 2020 where he‘ll open the season against the Steelers, Bears, and 49ers. You‘re going to find him on waiver wires before long. In fact, he has one of the toughest schedules in the league, though the start is just brutal. What his 2019 season reminded me of was 2018 Mitch Trubisky. Don‘t believe me?

The magic number for a tight end to be considered a TE1 is right around 80 projected targets. We cannot get there with Hooper. Njoku and his agent know that this is a bad situation and want out, but the Browns have said they‘re holding onto him because Stefanski loves to use two tight ends.

The offensive line is the biggest concern for me, as that‘s the one thing that took a major step back last year, and it seriously impacted his numbers. The good news is that his pass attempts have been skyrocketing, which help make up for some of the decreased efficiency.

The best thing to do is get Ruggs the ball in his hands and let him create. Did you know that Jerry Jeudy had more than double the deep-ball receptions that Ruggs did while at Alabama? It‘s because Ruggs was used a lot on screens and reverses. Putting him in the slot will manufacture touches to get the ball in his hands and let him create. He shouldn‘t be pigeonholed to the slot, and I don‘t think he will be, but playing there is not a bad thing. Did you know slot targets are worth 10.8 percent more than perimeter targets? Seriously, I‘ve done the research (can be read here). On top of that, Derek Carr had the lowest average depth of target among quarterbacks last year, so should love someone like Ruggs who creates after the catch. When a team spends a No. 12 overall pick on someone, they‘re going to find ways to get him the ball, so finding out the slot is his primary home makes you feel better about his potential in year one. I‘d say his floor should be around 70 targets with a ceiling of 100 targets. He should also get some carries mixed in. Because of that combined with his one-play upside, he‘s worth WR3 consideration. Fortunately, you don‘t have to use a high pick on him, as he‘s going around the 11th-12th round.

He‘s been highly efficient on almost all of those touches, but at some point, you have to ask yourself why he‘s not getting more. Seriously, his efficiency last year was out of this world.

His 0.67 fantasy points per actual pass attempt ranked as the fourth-best mark over the last 10 years. What made it all that more impressive is that he was sacked every 10.8 dropbacks, which was the third-most often in the league. By comparison, Drew Brees was sacked every 32.5 dropbacks.

For the sake of argument, let‘s raise that number to 500, which would be a massive difference. Even assigning Tannehill a number of 8.3 yards per attempt (Patrick Mahomes’ number from 2019), it would amount to 4,150 yards. Then let‘s say he throws a touchdown on 5.0 percent of his passes (Dak Prescott from 2019). That would amount to 25 touchdowns. So, 4,150 passing yards and 25 touchdowns while comparing him to Mahomes and Prescott, while raising his pass attempts up to 500? Do you see why it makes little sense to think Tannehill even approaches top-10 territory? By comparison, Tom Brady threw for 4,057 yards and 24 touchdowns last year - he was hardly usable.

Still, it‘ll be hard for him to overtake Courtland Sutton as the team‘s leader in targets. Jeudy can play many roles, including being the deep threat down the field, playing the possession-style role, or moving into the slot, which he did regularly at Alabama. Sutton isn‘t someone who‘ll move into the slot very often, which is a good thing for Jeudy, as Shurmur‘s slot receivers have done damage in the past. Again, the negative is that fellow rookie KJ Hamler is also a slot presence who‘s going to get some playing time. There‘s a path to Jeudy being a Terry McLaurin-like fantasy option this year, but his path to targets is not as easy. If Sutton stays on the field, Jeudy will be too inconsistent to trust on a weekly basis.

However, I don‘t know if I‘ve seen a quarterback with Burrow‘s confidence and swag come into the league in a long time. He‘s also walking into a situation where he has one of the best wide receiver depth charts in the league (when healthy). The offense that Zac Taylor ran last year presented plenty of opportunity, as Andy Dalton finished with the 12th most expected fantasy points despite missing three full games. He threw the ball at least 36 times in 11-of-13 games, including three games with 50-plus attempts. The offensive line is a problem, though it helps he‘ll get last year‘s first-round pick Jonah Williams back at left tackle. While the pass attempts and talent at wide receiver are great, what should attract you to Burrow is his willingness to run with the ball. Sure, he broke records as a passer at LSU, but he also rushed for nearly 800 yards and 12 touchdowns over the last two years. That adds breakout potential to a quarterback, so when you combine that with his arm talent, he makes for an ideal QB2 in fantasy. The Bengals defense is in a complete rebuild mode, and while they‘ve added talent this offseason, it‘ll take time for them to come together. They allowed 26.2 points per game last year (8th most), so if they continue to struggle, Burrow could become 2020‘s version of Jameis Winston.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I classified him as more fast than quick, as he is shifty in routes, but lacks elite short-area burst. I thought he‘d be a field stretcher who could eventually turn into a complete receiver with some refinement in his intermediate routes. Knowing Garoppolo was arguably the best deep-ball passer in the league last year, that seems like a match. The issue is that the 49ers had him throw deep just 6.5 percent of the time, which was the lowest in the league. We need those numbers to go up for Aiyuk to truly explode. Knowing his early season schedule, it‘s not a bad idea to snag him as a WR5 and see what happens.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

161,Philip Rivers IND ,QB24,171.1,7,"There‘s no masking it, Rivers was bad in 2019. He‘s now 38 years old (will be 39 in December), which is the age quarterbacks used to hit their decline (before Brady and Brees came along). Have we reached the end with him? He played behind a bad offensive line last year, something he‘s done through much of his career. In 2020, he‘ll play behind a top-three offensive line in football. He has already played under Frank Reich back when he threw for 4,286 yards and 31 touchdowns, then a career-high 4,792 yards and 29 touchdowns in 2015. Does that make a difference knowing it was five years ago? Well, yeah, in a way. The good news is that he at least knows the basics of the offense, which is important this year when we‘ve had practically no offseason. The bad news is that chemistry will have to be built on the fly, and it‘s even harder when your top receiver (T.Y. Hilton) shows up to camp on the injured list. We did see Jacoby Brissett and Brian Hoyer combine for 22 touchdown passes last year and Andrew Luck throw for 39 touchdowns in 2018, so it‘s a good offense. If you want to select Rivers in a 2QB format, it could pay dividends, though his fantasy floor might be a bit lower than someone like Gardner Minshew who uses his legs.

Knowing that Watkins is the No. 2 option at wide receiver in a Patrick Mahomes-led offense and that he‘s going outside the top-50 wide receivers is bananas. Sure, he was bad in 2019, but he looked like the player we thought he‘d be once they got to the playoffs, as he compiled 14 receptions for 288 yards and a touchdown on 18 targets in their three playoff games. The Chiefs also had an opportunity to move on from Watkins this offseason, but they decided to keep him on the roster. He may not be an every-week option from the get-go, but knowing you have a player tied to Patrick Mahomes who saw six-plus targets in 10-of-17 games last year should carry some weight. Snagging him as a WR4/5 with upside makes too much sense, as we can‘t let one inefficient year erase what he‘s been throughout his career.

Pair them with Courtland Sutton, Phillip Lindsay, and Noah Fant, and you suddenly have one of the most talented rooms in the league. It‘s tough to judge anything we saw from Lock in his rookie season, as he was asked to start late in the season, and it was a different coordinator. What we do know is that Pat Shurmur is his new offensive coordinator, and he‘s produced some solid quarterback play in his time. The last time he was a coordinator was 2017 when he coached Case Keenum to a 68 percent completion rate, 22 touchdowns, and just seven interceptions. My concern with Lock is that this is still Vic Fangio‘s team, and their defense should be very good. If Fangio doesn‘t give full reigns to Shurmur, we‘re likely to see a defensive-minded, run-heavy offense, which would cripple Lock‘s fantasy appeal. The high end for Lock‘s pass attempts is likely in the 525-attempt range, which isn‘t great for a quarterback with limited mobility.

The defense is in a position to allow a ton of points, which does add appeal to Bridgewater. We should see him rack up the pass attempts, and it doesn‘t hurt to know that his 6.2 intended air yards per target was the lowest in the league, which should mean a lot of short completions to D.J. Moore and Christian McCaffrey. The issue is that Bridgewater offers no mobility after his reconstructive knee surgery. That means he‘ll have to be more efficient than other pocket passers available later in the draft, guys like Kirk Cousins and Jared Goff.

This is your reminder that Mike Williams is 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds, while Vincent Jackson was 6-foot-5 and 230 pounds. These are wide receivers that Rivers targeted relentlessly.

Over the last seven years, running backs drafted in the second round average 172.3 touches in their rookie season. Dillon is just an early-down back, so he‘ll be extremely touchdown dependent.

So, when you see that McCaffrey saw 141 targets last year, that‘s a big issue for someone like Thomas. You aren‘t going to take targets away from McCaffrey to feed him.

When Washington goes three-wide, Sims should be out there in the slot, but that‘s just my opinion. We could see Gibson or even Trey Quinn play that role.

Mims is a possession-style receiver who can stretch the field, as evidenced by his 4.38-second 40-yard dash he ran at the Combine. He should become a favorite of Sam Darnold in the red zone, as he plucks the ball out of the air with his strong mitts. He‘ll be battling with Breshad Perriman for targets on the perimeter, while Jamison Crowder remains the safety valve in the slot. Robby Anderson did see 96 targets last year while Demaryius Thomas saw 58 of them (in 11 games), so there‘s room for a fantasy producer. The issue is that Mims is a rookie who hasn‘t seen any preseason action and hasn‘t had much time to be around the team. The same can be said for Perriman, so there‘s a route to immediate production with Mims, though Adam Gase has not been friendly to perimeter wide receivers. Over the last four years, his top receivers were Jarvis Landry (twice), Danny Amendola, and Jamison Crowder... all slot receivers. It‘s best to be cautious with rookie wide receivers, especially this year, even if I like who Mims is as a player.

Chark in the slot a bit more, which tells us that Westbrook won‘t be pigeonholed into the slot role that he‘s been the last couple years. Westbrook has real speed on the perimeter and could be more than just a target-heavy slot receiver. We know that second-round pick Laviska Shenault had core muscle surgery this offseason which might put him behind the learning curve, and it‘s not like the Jaguars have any allegiance to Chris Conley, so it‘s possible that Westbrook is the 2020 version of Jamison Crowder in 2019 (finished as the WR31) with more vertical play upside.

There were a lot of times he was open for what would‘ve been a long gain/touchdown, but Andy Dalton simply missed him. Insert Joe Burrow, who completed 76.3 percent of his passes at LSU last year, including feather-like touch on his deep ball. Ross saw five-plus targets in 6-of-8 games last year, so it‘s clear that Zac Taylor felt he could make a difference.

Cephus was a top-10 wide receiver in this draft class and I was really curious where he‘d land. Knowing Marvin Jones has dealt with injuries over the last few years and that Danny Amendola will be 35 years old in a few months, there‘s a chance we see Cephus on the field sooner than expected.
